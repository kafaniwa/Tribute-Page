      <p id="tribute-info">Throughout his life, Mohg faced many challenges and problems as a result of his cursed omen nature. None greater than his dream to achieve his very own dynasty and laws of order, with the Formless Mother/ Mother of truth as his prospective outer God with whom to enact the divinity of his order. Believing to have found a path torwards redemption, much like his omen twin, Morgott, he was quickly struck down through a plan much greater than his endeavors. What was worse was the attributes wrongly assigned to him after his passing which did not come to light until the dlc for Elden Ring was released. Mohg through his actions of kidnapping Miquella the Empyrean was labelled a predator and sexual deviant by most of the community. His actions have turned out to be the machinations of Miquella who controlled and manipulated a large number of people, brainwashing them into his doing. Now that Mohg has been exonorated, we do what we can to remember the fallen lord of blood in a better light. Rest in peace Mohg, you Nihil'd too close to the sun.</p>
